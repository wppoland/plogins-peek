Fast product preview popup for WooCommerce: an AJAX product modal with gallery, price, SKU and add-to-cart. No jQuery.

== Description ==

Peek adds a product quick view button to your WooCommerce shop and archive product loops. Clicking it opens an accessible AJAX product modal, so shoppers can preview products, choose options and add to cart without leaving the listing.

The modal shows the featured image and gallery thumbnails, title, SKU, price, stock status, short description, the native add-to-cart form (including variable products), and a link to the full product page. Each part can be toggled from the settings screen.

* **Bug reports and feature requests** - [GitHub issues](https://github.com/wppoland/plogins-peek/issues)


= Built for speed and accessibility =

* **No jQuery** in the plugin's own front-end code, the script is vanilla JS, deferred, and loaded in the footer.
* **No layout shift (CLS).** The modal is fully hidden until opened and scrolls internally, so it never reflows the page.
* **Focus-trapped & keyboard friendly.** Focus moves into the dialog on open, is trapped while it is open, closes on Escape or backdrop click, and returns to the trigger button on close. The dialog uses `role="dialog"` with `aria-modal`.
* **Variation aware.** The add-to-cart form supports variable products via WooCommerce's own variation script.

= Settings =

A WooCommerce-capability settings page (Peek menu) lets you:

* Enable or disable the quick view.
* Set the trigger button label and style (text, icon, or icon + text).
* Choose where it loads: shop and product archives only, or also the related/up-sell loops on single product pages.
* Configure the modal chrome: title, close-button label, loading and error text, the "view product" link text and the SKU label, plus toggles for the modal heading, close button and backdrop-click close.
* Choose which parts render in the modal (image, gallery with a configurable thumbnail count, title, SKU, price, stock status, short description, add-to-cart, full-product link).

= Shortcode =

Place a quick-view trigger anywhere with `[peek_quick_view id="123"]`, or the shorter `[peek id="123"]` alias. Optional attributes: `text` (custom label) and `style` (`text`, `icon`, or `icon_text`). The modal and its assets load automatically wherever the shortcode appears.

Peek is developed in the open. The code, open issues and release history live at [GitHub](https://github.com/wppoland/plogins-peek), bug reports and patches are welcome there.

= Upgrade to Peek PRO =

Peek PRO extends the free quick view with:

* Recently viewed products.
* A related-products carousel inside the modal.
* Colour and label variation swatches.
* Custom modal sections.
* Previous / next navigation between products without closing the modal.
* Extra styling controls.
* Quick-view analytics.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to `/wp-content/plugins/plogins-peek`, or install via Plugins > Add New.
2. Activate it. WooCommerce must be active.
3. Visit the **Peek** menu in wp-admin to configure the button label and modal contents.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it require WooCommerce? =

Yes. Peek requires an active WooCommerce installation.

= Does it use jQuery? =

The plugin's own front-end script is vanilla JavaScript with no jQuery dependency. When a product has variations, WooCommerce's bundled variation script (which itself uses jQuery) is enqueued so the variation form works as expected.

= Where does the quick-view button appear? =

On the shop page and product archive loops (categories, tags, taxonomies), after each product. It does not change single product pages.

= Does the modal support add to cart? =

Yes. Peek renders WooCommerce's native add-to-cart form inside the quick shop modal, including quantity and variable-product choices.

= Does it work with variable products? =

Yes. Variable products use WooCommerce's own variation form inside the product modal, so shoppers can choose a variation before adding to cart.

= Will it cause layout shift? =

No. The modal is hidden until opened and overlays the page, so opening it never reflows existing content.

= Can I place a quick-view button manually? =

Yes. Use `[peek_quick_view id="123"]` or `[peek id="123"]` to add a product quick view trigger in custom layouts.


= Does this plugin work on WordPress Multisite? =

Yes. This plugin is compatible with WordPress Multisite. Network activate it or activate it on individual sites; each site keeps its own settings and data.

== Screenshots ==

1. The quick-view modal showing the product gallery, price and add-to-cart form.
2. The Peek settings screen.

== External Services ==

Peek does not connect to any external services. The quick-view modal fetches its product fragment from your own site over WordPress' `admin-ajax.php` (the `peek_quick_view` action), so no shopper or product data ever leaves your server. Peek's only stored data is two WordPress options it creates, `peek_settings` (your modal and button configuration) and `peek_db_version`, both removed when the plugin is deleted. Peek sends no email and loads no third-party scripts, fonts or analytics.

== Translations ==

Plogins Peek is fully translatable and ships the `plogins-peek.pot` template. Translations are delivered by WordPress.org language packs from translate.wordpress.org, which is where Polish, German and Spanish are being contributed; the package itself carries no compiled translation files.

== Changelog ==

= 1.0.22 =
* Fixed: the PRO upgrade promo kept selling to people who had already bought the paid edition. Only the banner could be dismissed, so the sidebar promo and the locked feature cards followed a paying customer around for good. The promo now checks whether the paid edition is active and steps aside when it is.
* Fixed: arrow glyphs in the admin menu paths, and in the strings handed to translators. An arrow inside a translatable string makes the glyph every translator's problem and changes the layout in any locale that drops it.

= 1.0.21 =
* Changed: the PRO feature cards printed an arrow glyph in menu paths where the rest of the plugin and the documentation use a plain ">". Same navigation, one character that renders everywhere.

= 1.0.20 =
* Fixed: deleting the plugin left the per-user "dismiss" flag from the PRO notice in the database. Uninstall now removes it for every user, not just the one who dismissed it.

= 1.0.19 =
* Fixed: every customer-facing string was untranslatable. The button label, the modal title, the close label, the loading and error messages, the SKU prefix and the view-product link shipped as English sentences in a config file and were written into the settings option the moment the plugin activated, so a shop running in another language showed English however complete its language pack was. The settings screen already offered to fall back to a default for a blank field; the packaged value meant blank never happened.
* The defaults are now translated strings resolved when the label is about to be shown, never written back to the database. A label you typed yourself is still used exactly as typed.
* On update, a label left byte for byte as the English default is cleared so the translated one takes over. Anything you edited, including a hand translation, is matched exactly and kept.

= 1.0.18 =
* Fixed: the plugin reported an older version number internally than the one it was released under. That number versions the stylesheets and scripts the admin screen loads, so a browser holding the previous files kept them after an update instead of fetching the corrected ones.
* Fixed: the package no longer ships its own translation files. WordPress.org builds language packs from translate.wordpress.org, and a bundled catalogue shadows that pack, so a translation corrected upstream could not reach you until the next release. Your language now comes from the language pack, which is the copy that stays current.

= 1.0.17 =
* Declared compatibility with WooCommerce 11.0.

= 1.0.16 =
* Fixed the PRO promo on the settings screen quoting a price in PLN. PRO is priced and charged in EUR, so an admin on a Polish site was shown a zloty amount and then billed in euro, and the zloty figure was a fixed conversion that drifted from the real charge as the rate moved. The promo now shows the euro price that is actually taken.

= 1.0.15 =
* The "Modal heading" setting now works: the modal title appears above the product instead of being wiped the moment the product loaded.
* Turning off "Product image" now really hides it. Products with no gallery no longer showed the featured photo (or the placeholder) anyway, and the summary now uses the full width when there is no image to show.

= 1.0.14 =
* The PRO notice no longer calls the custom modal sections plain HTML. They are stored as post-safe HTML, so scripts and iframes are stripped, and the notice now says so.

= 1.0.13 =
* Fix: the quick-view button no longer prints in the related and up-sell loops on single product pages, where the modal it opens is not loaded. It obeys the same "where to load" setting as the modal itself.
* The modal now announces when it has finished loading a product, which is what Peek Pro's quick-view analytics counts. Without it that screen could only ever show zeros.

= 1.0.11 =
* Translations: completed Polish, German and Spanish for the PRO upgrade panel.

= 1.0.10 =
* Declared compatibility with WooCommerce 10.9.

= 1.0.9 =
* Description: converted the links in the readme to proper anchors (documentation, plugin page, source, related plugins).

= 1.0.8 =
* Added an in-plugin Peek PRO upsell (dismissible banner + feature cards) on the settings screen.

= 1.0.7 =
* Shortened display name (dropped the Plogins prefix; slug unchanged).

= 1.0.6 =
* Reverted Author header to WPPoland.com to match the plugin family (author credit is the motylanogha contributor).

= 1.0.5 =
* Author header now credits Mariusz Szatkowski (motylanogha).

= 1.0.4 =
* Readme: added Peek PRO and related Plogins plugins links.

= 1.0.3 =
* Clearer name: Plogins Peek - Product Preview for WooCommerce.

= 1.0.2 =
* Added bundled Polish, German and Spanish translations for the plugin interface.

= 1.0.1 =
* First stable release.

= 0.3.1 =
* Renamed to Plogins Peek for WooCommerce for a more distinctive plugin name.

= 0.3.0 =
* New: loop button placement, below the card or overlay on the thumbnail (hover/focus).
* New: `[peek]` shortcode as an alias for `[peek_quick_view]`.

= 0.2.0 =
* New: `[peek_quick_view]` shortcode to place a quick-view trigger anywhere, with optional `id`, `text` and `style` attributes.
* New: stock status row in the modal, with a toggle.
* New: configurable gallery thumbnail count (0-12).
* New: trigger button style, text, icon, or icon + text (icon-only keeps an accessible name).
* New: display scope, load on shop/archives only, or also single-product related/up-sell loops.
* New: modal chrome controls in the settings page (title, close-button label, loading/error text, view-product link text, SKU label, and toggles for the modal heading, close button and backdrop-click close).
* New: `uninstall.php` removes the plugin's options on delete.
* Added Domain Path for translations.

= 0.1.0 =
* Initial release: accessible AJAX quick-view modal for WooCommerce shop and archive loops, with a settings page for the button label and modal contents.
